aec:associatedFloraNotes and aec:associatedFaunaNotes fields will be the "notes" fields. These data are already somewhat structured in the dataset, but these notes fields contain the original verbatim label data. 

Parasitoids are small wasps that lay eggs in or on another organism. In our records, that other organism is typically an insect or another arthropod. When the records are recorded, it is important to note where the parasitoids host insect is feeding, or on what plant the host of the parasitoid is feeding. This is why you will see notes about plants and insects as hosts for a single parasiotid record.
